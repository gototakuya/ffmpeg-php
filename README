PHP extension for ffmpeg
========================

Description
-----------
ffmpeg-php is an extension for PHP that adds an easy to use, object-oriented API for accessing and retrieving information from video and audio files. It has methods for returning frames from movie files as images that can be manipulated using PHP's image functions. This works well for automatically creating thumbnail images from movies. ffmpeg-php is also useful for reporting the duration and bitrate of audio files (mp3, wma...). ffmpeg-php can access many of the video formats supported by ffmpeg (mov, avi, mpg, wmv...).

Originally hosted at http://ffmpeg-php.sourceforge.net, the project seems to be abandoned right now.
So here is a fork of it with minor modifications required to make it work with recent PHP versions.
